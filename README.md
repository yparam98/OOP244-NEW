## NOTE:

### NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO COPY, CLONE, PULL, FORK, FETCH, REPRODUCE, OR IN ANY WAY PASS OFF ANY PART OF **MY** CODE AS THEIR OWN WITHOUT THE EXPLICIT WRITTEN PERMISSION OF MYSELF! 

### IF YOU HAVE REACHED A POINT IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU FEEL THE NEED TO COPY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK TO PASS A COURSE, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TAKING A GOOD LONG LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND RECONSIDERING THE LIFE CHOICES THAT YOU'VE MADE TO GET TO THIS POINT. 

#### If you need help with some C++ code, please do not hesitate to ask me. I am willing to help in any way that I humanly can. What I will NOT tolerate is people copying MY code WITHOUT my permission, pass it off as their own (to the same professor, I might add), and then blaming me for making it so easily accessible. -_-
