## NOTE:

### NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO COPY, CLONE, PULL, REPRODUCE, OR IN ANY WAY PASS OFF ANY PART OF **MY** CODE AS THEIR OWN WITHOUT THE EXPLICIT WRITTEN PERMISSION OF MYSELF! IF YOU HAVE REACHED A POINT IN YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU FEEL THE NEED TO COPY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK TO PASS A COURSE, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TAKING A GOOD LONG LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND RECONSIDERING THE LIFE CHOICES THAT YOU'VE MADE TO GET TO THIS POINT. IF YOU NEED HELP, ASK! DON'T COPY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK AND DRAG ME DOWN WITH YOU!
